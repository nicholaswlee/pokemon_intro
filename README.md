# README Pokemon Intro
## Simulates The Pokemon Intro, Using Python and JSON for Dialogue
<br/>
Hello! This was a mini project I created testing I/O with python and read JSON data. This mimics the intro of Pokemon. 
Use the command ` python3 rivalBattle.py  ` to run the simulation <br/>
To create the dialogue and make it adaptive to input, I used JSON to create trees to have different routes for when users selected different options.
